Java War Game
This is a simple war game designed to test knowledge of Java and Object-Oriented Programming.

Game Rules
Two player names are entered at the beginning of the game.
A deck of cards is then dealt equally between the two players.
In each round, both players play a card from the top of their deck.
The player with the highest card value wins the round and earns one point. If there is a tie, no points are awarded.
The game continues until all cards have been played.
The player with the highest total points at the end of the game wins.
Usage
To use the program, simply run the Main.java file. The program will prompt you to enter the names of the two players, and then it will begin the game.

During the game, each round is displayed in the console, showing the cards played by each player and the outcome of the round.

Additional Information
This program was created as a personal project to enhance my skills in Java and OOP. It is a basic implementation of the classic card game "War", and could be further expanded upon to include additional features and functionality.
